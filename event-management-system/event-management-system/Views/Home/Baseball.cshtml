                    History of baseball
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The history of baseball can be broken into various aspects, by era, locale, organizational-type,
                    game evolution, as well as by political and cultural influence. The game evolved from older
                    bat-and-ball games already being played in England by the mid-18th century. This game was brought
                    by immigrants to North America, where the modern version developed.  BY the late 19th century,
                    baseball was widely recognized as the national sport of the United States. Baseball is popular in
                    North America and parts of central and South America, the Caribbean, Easr Asia particularly in
                    Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan.

                    References to baseball date back to the 1700s where in England it was referenced in 1744 in the
                    children's book A Little Pretty Pocket-Book. In the early 1800s "baseball" and a game first
                    mentioned in 1828 as "rounders" may have been the same or very similar. During the 1830s and
                    1840s organized amateur club baseball grew up in eastern United States cities, and the rules
                    innovations made by New York City clubs became the basis for the modern game, far removed from
                    its English ancestor. These clubs formed a national governing body with uniform rules in 1858,
                    the National Association of Base Ball Players. In 1871 the first professional league, the
                    National Association of Professional Base Ball Players, was founded. Five years later, the
                    National League of Professional Base Ball Clubs (National League) was created; it was followed
                    by the American League in 1901. The first World Series between the champions of the two major
                    leagues was held in 1903, and by 1905 it became an annual event. Baseball early in the 20th
                    century was characterized by low-scoring games, but the dead-ball era ended in the early 1920s
                    with rule changes and the rise of power hitter Babe Ruth. The major leagues had a color barrier
                    that lasted until 1947, when Jackie Robinson made his debut. The major leagues began the process
                    of expansion in 1961 and attendance increased from the mid-1970s to 1994, when a work stoppage
                    led to the cancellation of the World Series.

                    Professional baseball leagues featured teams from Canada as early as 1877, and the sport spread
                    to numerous countries in the 1800s and 1900s. It was played in the Olympics as a medal sport from
                    1992 to 2008. Other competitions between national teams include the Baseball World Cup and the
                    World Baseball Classic, which was first held in 2006.

                    The evolution of baseball from older bat-and-ball games is difficult to trace with precision.
                    A French manuscript from 1344 contains an illustration of clerics playing a game, possibly la
                    soule, with similarities to baseball. Other old French games such as thèque, la balle au bâton,
                    and la balle empoisonnée also appear to be related. Consensus once held that today's baseball
                    is a North American development from the older game rounders, popular in Great Britain and
                    Ireland. Baseball Before We Knew It: A Search for the Roots of the Game (2005), by David Block,
                    suggests that the game originated in England; recently uncovered historical evidence supports this
                    position. Block argues that rounders and early baseball were actually regional variants of each other,
                    and that the game's most direct antecedents are the English games of stoolball and "tut-ball".
                    It has long been believed that cricket also descended from such games, though evidence uncovered
                    in early 2009 suggests that cricket may have been imported to England from Flanders.

                             ball being hit, the boy running to the next post, and then home to score.
                             Updated to four bases by 1828, rounders has remained extremely popular among
                             children in the UK." />

                <p>
                    The earliest known reference to baseball is in a 1744 British children's publication, A Little Pretty
                    Pocket-Book, by John Newbery. It contains a rhymed description of "base-ball" and a woodcut that shows
                    a field set-up somewhat similar to the modern game—though in a triangular rather than diamond
                    configuration, and with posts instead of ground-level bases. Block discovered that the first
                    recorded game of "Bass-Ball" took place in 1749 in Surrey, and featured the Prince of Wales as a player.
                    William Bray, an English lawyer, recorded a game of baseball on Easter Monday 1755 in Guildford, Surrey.
                    This early form of the game was apparently brought to Canada by English immigrants. Rounders was also
                    brought to the United States by Canadians of both British and Irish ancestry. The first known American
                    reference to baseball appears in a 1791 Pittsfield, Massachusetts town bylaw prohibiting the playing of
                    the game near the town's new meeting house. By 1796, a version of the game was well known enough to earn
                    a mention in a German scholar's book on popular pastimes. As described by Johann Gutsmuths, "englische
                    Base-ball" involved a contest between two teams, in which "the batter has three attempts to hit the ball
                    while at the home plate." Only one out was required to retire a side.

                    In 1828, William Clarke in London published the second edition of The Boy's Own Book, which included
                    the rules of rounders and contained the first printed description in English of a bat and ball
                    base-running game played on a diamond. The following year, the book was published in Boston,
                    Massachusetts.

                <p>
                    By the early 1830s, there were reports of a variety of uncodified bat-and-ball games recognizable as early
                    forms of baseball being played around North America. These games were often referred to locally as
                    "town ball", though other names such as "round-ball" and "base-ball" were also used. Among the earliest
                    examples to receive a detailed description—albeit five decades after the fact, in a letter from an
                    attendee to Sporting Life magazine—took place in Beachville, Ontario, in 1838. There were many similarities
                    to modern baseball, and some crucial differences: five bases (or byes); first bye just 18 feet (5.5 m) from
                    the home bye; batter out if a hit ball was caught after the first bounce. The once widely accepted story that
                    Abner Doubleday invented baseball in Cooperstown, New York, in 1839 has been conclusively debunked by sports
                    historians. The Doubleday myth appeared after a dispute arose about the origins of baseball and whether it
                    had been invented in the United States or developed as a variation of rounders. The theory that the sport
                    was created in the U.S. was backed by Chicago Cubs president Albert Spalding and National League president
                    Abraham G. Mills. In 1889, Mills gave a speech declaring that baseball was American, which he said was
                    determined through "patriotism and research"; a crowd of about 300 people responding by chanting "No rounders!"
                    The rounders theory was supported by prominent sportswriter Henry Chadwick, a native of Britain who noted
                    common factors between rounders and baseball in a 1903 article. In 1905, Spalding called for an
                    investigation into how the sport was invented. Chadwick supported the idea, and later in the year the Mills
                    commission was formed. Spalding instructed the commission to decide between the American game of "Old Cat"
                    and rounders as baseball's predecessor. Seven men served on the commission, including Mills. Spalding
                    chose the committee's members, picking men who supported his theory and excluding supporters of the rounders
                    claim, such as Chadwick.

                <p>
                    In 1845, Alexander Cartwright, a member of New York City's Knickerbocker Club, produced a code of baseball
                    rules now called the Knickerbocker Rules. The practice, common to bat-and-ball games of the day, of "soaking"
                    or "plugging"—effecting a putout by hitting a runner with a thrown ball—was barred. The rules thus facilitated
                    the use of a smaller, harder ball than had been common. Several other rules also brought the Knickerbockers'
                    game close to the modern one, though a ball caught on the first bounce was, again, an out and only underhand
                    pitching was allowed. While there are reports that the New York Knickerbockers played games in 1845, the
                    contest long recognized as the first officially recorded baseball game in U.S. history took place on June 19,
                    1846, in Hoboken, New Jersey: the "New York Nine" defeated the Knickerbockers, 23–1, in four innings. With
                    the Knickerbocker code as the basis, the rules of modern baseball continued to evolve over the next
                    half-century.

                <p>
                    In the mid-1850s, a baseball craze hit the New York metropolitan area. By 1856, local journals were referring
                    to baseball as the "national pastime" or "national game." A year later, 16 area clubs formed the sport's first
                    governing body, the National Association of Base Ball Players. In 1863, the organization disallowed putouts
                    made by catching a fair ball on the first bounce. Four years later, it barred participation by African Americans.
                    The game's commercial potential was developing: in 1869 the first fully professional baseball club, the Cincinnati
                    Red Stockings, was formed and went undefeated against a schedule of semipro and amateur teams. They still remain
                    as baseball's only undefeated team during the regular season. The first professional league, the National
                    Association of Professional Base Ball Players, lasted from 1871 to 1875; scholars dispute its status as a
                    major league.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The more formally structured National League was founded in 1876. As the oldest surviving major league, the
                    National League is sometimes referred to as the "senior circuit." Several other major leagues formed and failed.
                    In 1884, African American Moses Walker (and, briefly, his brother Welday) played in one of these, the American
                    Association. An injury ended Walker's major league career, and by the early 1890s, a gentlemen's agreement in
                    the form of the baseball color line effectively barred black players from the white-owned professional leagues,
                    major and minor. Professional Negro leagues formed, but quickly folded. Several independent African American teams
                    succeeded as barnstormers. Also in 1884, overhand pitching was legalized. In 1887, softball, under the name of
                    indoor baseball or indoor-outdoor, was invented as a winter version of the parent game. Virtually all of the
                    modern baseball rules were in place by 1893; the last major change—counting foul balls as strikes—was instituted
                    in 1901. The National League's first successful counterpart, the American League, which evolved from the minor
                    Western League, was established that year. The two leagues, each with eight teams, were rivals that fought for
                    the best players, often disregarding each other's contracts and engaging in bitter legal disputes.

                    A modicum of peace was eventually established, leading to the National Agreement of 1903. The pact formalized
                    relations both between the two major leagues and between them and the National Association of Professional
                    Base Ball Leagues, representing most of the country's minor professional leagues. The National Baseball
                    Commission was created to oversee Organized Baseball. The World Series, pitting the two major league champions
                    against each other, was inaugurated that fall, albeit without express major league sanction: The Boston
                    Americans of the American League defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates of the National League.
                    The next year, the series was not held, as the National League champion New York Giants, under
                    manager John McGraw, refused to recognize the major league status of the American League and its
                    champion. In 1905, the Giants were National League champions again and team management relented,
                    leading to the establishment of the World Series as the major leagues' annual championship event.

                    As professional baseball became increasingly profitable, players frequently raised grievances against
                    owners over issues of control and equitable income distribution. During the major leagues' early decades,
                    players on various teams occasionally attempted strikes, which routinely failed when their jobs were
                    sufficiently threatened. In general, the strict rules of baseball contracts and the reserve clause, which
                    bound players to their teams even when their contracts had ended, tended to keep the players in check.
                    Motivated by dislike for particularly stingy owner Charles Comiskey and gamblers' payoffs, real and
                    promised, members of the Chicago White Sox conspired to throw the 1919 World Series. The Black Sox
                    Scandal led to the dissolution of the National Baseball Commission and the formation of the office of the
                    Commissioner of Baseball. The first commissioner, Kenesaw Mountain Landis, was elected in 1920. That year
                    also saw the founding of the Negro National League; the first significant Negro league, it would operate
                    until 1931. For part of the 1920s, it was joined by the Eastern Colored League.

                    Compared with the present, professional baseball in the early 20th century was lower-scoring, and
                    pitchers, including stars Walter Johnson and Christy Mathewson, were more dominant. The "inside game",
                    which demanded that players "scratch for runs", was played much more aggressively than it is today:
                    the brilliant and often violent Ty Cobb epitomized this style. The so-called dead-ball era ended in
                    the early 1920s with several changes in rule and circumstance that were advantageous to hitters.
                    Strict new regulations governing the ball's size, shape and composition, along with a new rule officially
                    banning the spitball and other pitches that depended on the ball being treated or roughed-up with foreign
                    substances, followed the death of Ray Chapman after a pitch struck him in the head in August 1920. Coupled
                    with superior materials available after World War I, this resulted in a ball that traveled farther when hit.
                    The construction of additional seating to accommodate the rising popularity of the game often had the effect
                    of reducing the distance to the outfield fences, making home runs more common. The rise of the legendary
                    player Babe Ruth, the first great power hitter of the new era, helped permanently alter the nature of the
                    game. The club with which Ruth set most of his slugging records, the New York Yankees, built a reputation
                    as the majors' premier team. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, St. Louis Cardinals general manager Branch
                    Rickey invested in several minor league clubs and developed the first modern "farm system". A new Negro
                    National League was organized in 1933; four years later, it was joined by the Negro American League.
                    The first elections to the National Baseball Hall of Fame took place in 1936. In 1939 Little League
                    Baseball was founded in Pennsylvania. By the late 1940s, it was the organizing body for children's
                    baseball leagues across the United States.

                <p>
                    With America's entry into World War II, many professional players had left to serve in the armed forces. 
                    A large number of minor league teams disbanded as a result and the major league game seemed under threat 
                    as well. Chicago Cubs owner Philip K. Wrigley led the formation of a new professional league with women 
                    players to help keep the game in the public eye—the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League existed 
                    from 1943 to 1954. The inaugural College World Series was held in 1947, and the Babe Ruth League youth 
                    program was founded. This program soon became another important organizing body for children's baseball. 
                    The first crack in the unwritten rules barring blacks from white-controlled professional ball occurred 
                    the previous year: Jackie Robinson was signed by the National League's Brooklyn Dodgers—where Branch Rickey 
                    had become general manager—and began playing for their minor league team in Montreal. In 1947, Robinson 
                    broke the major leagues' color barrier when he debuted with the Dodgers; Larry Doby debuted with the 
                    American League's Cleveland Indians later the same year. Latin American players, largely overlooked 
                    before, also started entering the majors in greater numbers. In 1951, two Chicago White Sox, Venezuelan-born 
                    Chico Carrasquel and black Cuban-born Minnie Miñoso, became the first Hispanic All-Stars.

                <p>
                    Facing competition as varied as television and football, baseball attendance at all levels declined. 
                    While the majors rebounded by the mid-1950s, the minor leagues were gutted and hundreds of semipro and 
                    amateur teams dissolved. Integration proceeded slowly: by 1953, only six of the 16 major league teams 
                    had a black player on the roster. That year, the Major League Baseball Players Association was founded. 
                    It was the first professional baseball union to survive more than briefly, but it remained largely 
                    ineffective for years. No major league team had been located west of St. Louis until 1958, when the 
                    Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants relocated to Los Angeles and San Francisco, respectively. The
                    majors' final all-white bastion, the Boston Red Sox, added a black player in 1959. With the integration 
                    of the majors drying up the available pool of players, the last Negro league folded the following year.
                    In 1961, the American League reached the West Coast with the Los Angeles Angels expansion team, and the 
                    major league season was extended from 154 games to 162. This coincidentally helped Roger Maris break Babe 
                    Ruth's long-standing single-season home run record, one of the most celebrated marks in baseball. Along 
                    with the Angels, three other new franchises were launched during 1961–62. With this, the first major 
                    league expansion in 60 years, each league now had ten teams.

                    The players' union became bolder under the leadership of former United Steelworkers chief economist and 
                    negotiator Marvin Miller, who was elected executive director in 1966. On the playing field, major league 
                    pitchers were becoming increasingly dominant again. After the 1968 season, in an effort to restore balance, 
                    the strike zone was reduced and the height of the pitcher's mound was lowered from 15 to 10 inches 
                    (38.1–25.4 cm). In 1969, both the National and American Leagues added two more expansion teams, the leagues 
                    were reorganized into two divisions each, and a post-season playoff system leading to the World Series was 
                    instituted. Also that same year, Curt Flood of the St. Louis Cardinals made the first serious legal challenge 
                    to the reserve clause. The major leagues' first general players' strike took place in 1972, delaying the 
                    season's start for two weeks. In another effort to add more offense to the game, the American League 
                    adopted the designated hitter rule the following year. In 1975, the union's power—and players' salaries—began 
                    to increase greatly when the reserve clause was effectively struck down, leading to the free agency system.
                    In 1977, two more expansion teams joined the American League. Significant work stoppages occurred again in 
                    1981 and 1994, the latter forcing the cancellation of the World Series for the first time in 90 years. 
                    Attendance had been growing steadily since the mid-1970s and in 1994, before the stoppage, the majors 
                    were setting their all-time record for per-game attendance.

                <p>
                    The addition of two more expansion teams after the 1993 season had facilitated another restructuring of the 
                    major leagues, this time into three divisions each. Offensive production—the number of home runs in 
                    particular—had surged that year, and again in the abbreviated 1994 season. After play resumed in 1995, 
                    this trend continued and non-division-winning wild card teams became a permanent fixture of the 
                    post-season. Regular-season interleague play was introduced in 1997 and the second-highest attendance 
                    mark for a full season was set. The next year, Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa both surpassed Maris's 
                    decades-old single-season home run record, and two more expansion franchises were added. In 2000, the 
                    National and American Leagues were dissolved as legal entities. While their identities were maintained 
                    for scheduling purposes (and the designated hitter distinction), the regulations and other functions—such 
                    as player discipline and umpire supervision—they had administered separately were consolidated under the 
                    rubric of Major League Baseball (MLB).

                    In 2001, Barry Bonds established the current record of 73 home runs in a single season. There had long 
                    been suspicions that the dramatic increase in power hitting was fueled in large part by the abuse of 
                    illegal steroids (as well as by the dilution of pitching talent due to expansion), but the issue only 
                    began attracting significant media attention in 2002 and there was no penalty for the use of 
                    performance-enhancing drugs before 2004. In 2007, Bonds became MLB's all-time home run leader, 
                    surpassing Hank Aaron, as total major league and minor league attendance both reached all-time highs.
                    Even though McGwire, Sosa, and Bonds—as well as many other players, including storied pitcher Roger 
                    Clemens—have been implicated in the steroid abuse scandal, their feats and those of other sluggers 
                    had become the major leagues' defining attraction. In contrast to the professional game's resurgence 
                    in popularity after the 1994 interruption, Little League enrollment was in decline: after peaking in 
                    1996, it dropped 1 percent a year over the following decade. With more rigorous testing and penalties 
                    for performance-enhancing drug use a possible factor, the balance between bat and ball swung markedly 
                    in 2010, which became known as the "Year of the Pitcher". Runs per game fell to their lowest level in 
                    18 years, and the strikeout rate was higher than it had been in half a century.

                    Before the start of the 2012 season, MLB altered its rules to double the number of wild card teams 
                    admitted into the playoffs to two per league. The playoff expansion resulted in the addition of annual 
                    one-game playoffs between the wild card teams in each league.

                    Baseball, widely known as America's pastime, is well established in several other countries as well. 
                    The history of baseball in Canada has remained closely linked with that of the sport in the United States. 
                    As early as 1877, a professional league, the International Association, featured teams from both countries.
                    While baseball is widely played in Canada and many minor league teams have been based in the country, the 
                    American major leagues did not include a Canadian club until 1969, when the Montreal Expos joined the National 
                    League as an expansion team. In 1977, the expansion Toronto Blue Jays joined the American League. The Blue 
                    Jays won the World Series in 1992 and 1993, the first and still the only club from outside the United States 
                    to do so. After the 2004 season, Major League Baseball relocated the Expos to Washington, D.C., where the 
                    team is now known as the Nationals.

                    In 1847, American soldiers played what may have been the first baseball game in Mexico at Parque Los Berros 
                    in Xalapa, Veracruz. A few days after the Battle of Cerro Gordo, they used the "wooden leg captured 
                    (by the Fourth Illinois regiment) from General Santa Anna". The first formal baseball league outside of 
                    the United States and Canada was founded in 1878 in Cuba, which maintains a rich baseball tradition and 
                    whose national team has been one of the world's strongest since international play began in the late 1930s 
                    (all organized baseball in the country has officially been amateur since the Cuban Revolution). The 
                    Dominican Republic held its first islandwide championship tournament in 1912. Professional baseball 
                    tournaments and leagues began to form in other countries between the world wars, including the Netherlands 
                    (formed in 1922), Australia (1934), Japan (1936), Mexico (1937), and Puerto Rico (1938). The Japanese 
                    major leagues—the Central League and Pacific League—have long been considered the highest quality 
                    professional circuits outside of the United States. Japan has a professional minor league system as well, 
                    though it is much smaller than the American version—each team has only one farm club in contrast to MLB 
                    teams' four or five.

                    After World War II, professional leagues were founded in many Latin American countries, most prominently 
                    Venezuela (1946) and the Dominican Republic (1955). Since the early 1970s, the annual Caribbean Series 
                    has matched the championship clubs from the four leading Latin American winter leagues: the Dominican 
                    Professional Baseball League, Mexican Pacific League, Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League, and 
                    Venezuelan Professional Baseball League. In Asia, South Korea (1982), Taiwan (1990) and China (2003) 
                    all have professional leagues.

                    Many European countries have professional leagues as well, the most successful, other than the Dutch league, 
                    being the Italian league founded in 1948. Compared to those in Asia and Latin America, the various European 
                    leagues and the one in Australia historically have had no more than niche appeal. In 2004, Australia won a 
                    surprise silver medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics. The Israel Baseball League, launched in 2007, folded after 
                    one season. The Confédération Européene de Baseball (European Baseball Confederation), founded in 1953, organizes 
                    a number of competitions between clubs from different countries, as well as national squads. Other 
                    competitions between national teams, such as the Baseball World Cup and the Olympic baseball tournament, 
                    were administered by the International Baseball Federation (IBAF) from its formation in 1938 until its 2013 merger 
                    with the International Softball Federation to create the current joint governing body for both sports, the World 
                    Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC). By 2009, the IBAF had 117 member countries. Women's baseball is played 
                    on an organized amateur basis in numerous countries. Since 2004, the IBAF and now WBSC have sanctioned the 
                    Women's Baseball World Cup, featuring national teams.

                    After being admitted to the Olympics as a medal sport beginning at the 1992 Summer Olympics, baseball was dropped 
                    from the 2012 Summer Olympics at the 2005 International Olympic Committee meeting. It remained part of the 2008 
                    Summer Olympics. The elimination of baseball, along with softball, from the 2012 Olympic program enabled the IOC 
                    to consider adding two different sports, but none received the votes required for inclusion.[95] While the sport's 
                    lack of a following in much of the world was a factor, more important was Major League Baseball's reluctance to 
                    have a break during the Games to allow its players to participate, as the National Hockey League now does during 
                    the Winter Olympic Games. Such a break is more difficult for MLB to accommodate because it would force the playoffs 
                    deeper into cold weather. Seeking reinstatement for the 2016 Summer Olympics, the IBAF proposed an abbreviated 
                    competition designed to facilitate the participation of top players, but the effort failed. Major League Baseball 
                    initiated the World Baseball Classic, scheduled to precede the major league season, partly as a replacement, 
                    high-profile international tournament. The inaugural Classic, held in March 2006, was the first tournament 
                    involving national teams to feature a significant number of MLB participants. The Baseball World Cup was 
                    discontinued after its 2011 edition in favor of an expanded World Baseball Classic.
