                    Softball is a game similar to baseball played with a larger ball in a smaller field.
                    Softball is played competitively at club levels, the college level, and the professional
                    level. The game was first created in 1887 in chicago by George Hancock.

                    There are two rule sets for softball generally: slow pitchsoftball and fastpitch.
                    Slow pitch softball is commonly played recreationally, while  women's fastpitch softball
                    is a Summer Olympic sport and is played professionally.

                    Depending on the variety being played and the age and gender of the players, the
                    partiulars of field and equipment vary. While distances between bases of
                    <span>60 feet/ 18,3 metres </span>  are standard across varieties, the pitcher's palte ranges
                    <span>35 to 43 feet </span>away from the home plate, and the home run fence can be
                    <span>220 to 300 feet</span> away from the home plate. The ball itself is typically
                    <span>11 to 12 inches (28 or 30cm) </span> in curcumference, also depending on specifics of
                    the competition.

                    Softball rules vary somewhat from those of baseball. The game mcoes at a fasrer pace than 
                    traditional baseball due to the field being smaller and the bases and tbe fielders being closer
                    to the home plate. Softball is pitched underhand from flat ground, with fastpitch using a 
                    windmall arm motion, while baseball is pitched overhand from s small hill called a mound, which 
                    changes the flight of the pitch. Additionally, the entire infield of a softball diamond is dirt, 
                    without grass around the pitcher's plate.

                    The earliest known softball game was played in Chicago, Illinois, on Thanksgiving Day, 1887. It
                    took place at the Farragut Boat Club at a gathering to hear the outcome of the Yale University
                    and Harvard University football game. When the score was announced and bets were settled, a
                    <span>>Yale alumnus</span> threw a boxing glove at a Harvard supporter. The Harvard fan grabbed
                    a stick and swung at the rolled up glove. George Hancock, a reporter there, called out "Play ball!"
                    and the game began, with the boxing glove tightened into a ball, a broom handle serving as a bat.
                    This first contest ended with a score of 41–40. The ball, being soft, was fielded barehanded.

                    Hancock is credited as the game's inventor for his development of a 17" ball and an undersized bat 
                    in the next week. The Farragut Club soon set rules for the game, which spread quickly to outsiders. 
                    Envisioned as a way for baseball players to maintain their skills during the winter, the sport was 
                    called "Indoor Baseball". Under the name of "Indoor-Outdoor", the game moved outside in the next 
                    year, and the first rules were published in 1889.

                    In 1895 Lewis Rober, Sr. of Minneapolis organized outdoor games as exercise for firefighters; 
                    This game was known as kitten ball (after the first team to play it), lemon ball, or diamond ball. 
                    Rober's version of the game used a ball 12 inches (30 cm) in circumference, rather than the 
                    <span>16-inch (41 cm)</span> 
                    ball used by the Farragut club, and eventually the Minneapolis ball prevailed, although the dimensions 
                    of the Minneapolis diamond were passed over in favor of the dimensions of the Chicago one. Rober may 
                    not have been familiar with the Farragut Club rules. Fire Station No. 19 in Minneapolis, Rober's post from 
                    <span>1896 to 1906</span>, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in part for its association 
                    with the sport's development. The first softball league outside the United States was organized in Toronto in 
                    1897.
